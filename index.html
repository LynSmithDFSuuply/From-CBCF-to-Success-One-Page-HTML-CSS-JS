        <p>From a young age, we are told that college is too expensive. We are told only the wealthy go to college. We are told that we aren't "college material". Well, I am here to teach you how to go to college on an income below the poverty limit in Ohio. I have managed to attend school full-time, work part-time, pay for my own house which I maintain and afford alone, put food in my mouth, keep my utilities on, and take care of my animals and my son while still affording the personal items I want and need on very little income. I am here to break the stereotype of “unaffordable college”. </p>
     <br>
        <p>College has given me the ability to walk into a room full of professionals with confidence. It has taught me how to communicate in a proper way that results in me getting what I want. It has taught me how to think critically. It has taught me how to compose a professional email. I am a first-generation college graduate and I am here to share what I know with you guys.  </p>
        <br>
        <p class="padding">Not everyone would benefit from college. I only share my excitement about going to college with others because it has shaped me into an amazing human. Life is what you make of it. I needed something to conquer so that I could build my self-worth, especially after getting off probation. I was tired of struggling and hanging my head everywhere I went, so one day I woke up and said to myself, “I’m going to enroll in college” and that’s exactly what I did. Four years later, I am graduating. So, if you don’t resonate with this information, I wish you luck on your journey through life. </p>

            <h1>Do I want online courses or in-person courses?</h1>
           
            <p>i. Something to think about, in-person courses can be multiple hours long. This is a full-time job. Most professors will give points based on attendance as well, so you must be present.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>ii. With online courses, anywhere that has an internet connection, you can do your schoolwork. Any time of day. Most professors answer emails around the clock, 7 days a week, and are willing to have Zoom meetings with you most days to go over lesson plans. They want you to succeed. You can maintain employment while taking online courses without killing yourself and pushing too hard. In most courses, you can turn in your assignments at your leisure. There will be a few due dates for all the work and that is the only time restraint you will have. Online schooling has made achieving a state college degree attainable for people of all ages, races, and economic statuses. </p>

            <h1>What degree am I trying to achieve?</h1>
          
            <p>An Associate, a Bachelor, a Master? Maybe I just want to earn a certificate. An associate takes 2 years to earn, a bachelor takes 4 years to earn, and a master takes another 2 years to earn. Colleges have certificate programs as well, These can range from 9 months to 18 months. </p>

            <h1>Am I going to go full-time or part-time?</h1>
            <p>i.	The time you spend in college is based on credit hours. Typically, a single course will be 3 to 4 credit hours.  Full-time is considered anything above 12 credit hours. So, 4 courses, each with 3 credit hours will suffice for a qualification of full-time schooling.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ii.	 I have attended college full-time since the beginning for a few reasons. When you are full-time, you are eligible for assistance from the state for food and energy. You are automatically eligible for these services if you are a full-time student. Also, you get more money for your loans when you’re full-time. </p>
            <br>
            <p>iii.	I also attended college year-round, which means I took courses in the summer. I had a couple of reasons for doing this. I wanted to get school done as soon as possible, considering I am older and not straight out of high school. The sooner the better. Also, when you take courses in the summer, you get loan money in the summer. I relied on this loan money to pay my rent and utilities, so I needed it year-round. To be considered full-time you do not have to take courses in the summer.

            <h1>What do I want to learn about? </h1>
          
            <p>i.	Do you want to have a career doing something of service to others such as a nurse or a pilot? Do you want to have a career where you are in charge such as entrepreneurship or business? Do you want a career working with renewable energy and learning about the cutting-edge technology of the future? Do you want a job in IT as a software developer or gaming designer? </p>
            <br>
            <p>ii.	Consider location, maybe you want to move away to a new place and start fresh, which I highly endorse. Consider income. Look up the yearly salary for the career you are interested in. If you’re still reading then I can assume that basically any amount of money you see listed will be much more than you are currently making. Or maybe you just want security and health coverage. </p>
            <br>
            <p>iii.	Consider how much time you will need to dedicate to starting this career. How many hours per week? Is it a career that relies on someone’s opinion? One thing I am thankful for in my career is that everything I do at work has a yes or no answer. Nothing is opinion based. I didn’t want a job that could be influenced by anyone else but myself. Do you want a career that’s based on public opinion, such as an elected official or a news anchor? </p>
            <br>
            <p>iv.	Choose something that you have always been passionate about, just beware that once you see the underside of what’s really going on, your inspiration might lessen. When you go to college to learn about something, you learn all of it, the good and the bad. </p>
            <br>
            <p>v.	Also consider, for your conspiracy theorists out there, what information could they be misled on? I personally believe that some areas of information are skewed and influenced by money. So consider the content of what you’re learning and how relevant it is to the current political agenda. </p>

        <p>I wanted to create a place where the women who have completed CBCF can come to find resources all in the same place. I have a passion for helping people and what better people to help than my own people. I started from the same place these wonderful women have to start from, so I know their struggle. I have learned a plethora of skills to help me stay sober and to acheive success in life, so it is my turn to pay it forward. This site is my dedication to helping others that are going through the same struggles I have been through. </p>
